## My process

Created main div that will take the same measurements of the body webpage. Inside the main I created a product preview card compopent.

The component is divided into two parts 1.) Image of the product, 2.) Description of the product. I align the two parts using the grid layout.

Within the description I gave it padding all around and each block element a margin bottom.

For the button I use the flex layout for the prices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I had issues with obejct-fit property (firstly I used 'img' tag for loading the image), I switch from 'img' tag to css property 'background-image'. I learned that object-fit works with img tag. It is best to use the property 'background-size' for background images.
